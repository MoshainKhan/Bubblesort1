# Bubblesort1
Bubble sort is one of the first sorting algorithms you should master. While it isn't particularly efficient, it's simple and intuitive. Bubble Sort compares neighboring elements and forces larger elements to 'bubble' to the end of an array while simultaneously 'floating' smaller elements to the top/front of a list. This sorting algorithm is what you might do if you were asked to sort a list one by one.
